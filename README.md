# Art
An image-generating program, implemented in java. Custom images can be made by implementing the "Artist" or "PixelArtist" interface (with more possibilities likely to come).

This program has no dependencies other than the standard JRE (version 1.7).

A scripting system will be added eventually (after I have constructed my JarOS, which I will do... later).
